I am a post doctoral fellow in the Trapnell lab.Â I received my B.S. and M.S. in computer engineering from Tehran polytechnique in Tehran, Iran in 2009 and 2011. At that time my main focus was developing system level codes on GPUs and FPGAs, when I decided to do more applied research and I chose bioinformatics. I went to Virginia tech to get a Ph.D. in bioinformatics and computational biology at 2012. I started working with Ruth Grene, Eva Collakova, and Lenwood Heath studying soybean and Arabidopsis embryo development through analysis of RNA-Seq data. My main focus was studying splicing and noncoding RNA regulation through developing machine learning tools. I spent a summer in IBM. T.J Watson research center working on developing deep learning related methods to predict drug responses. In the Trapnell lab, I am working on the joint analysis of ATAC-Seq, RNA-Seq, and Hi-C data during differentiation process. 
I love tensors and I solve most of the data analysis problems using machine learning. I like to apply computer vision techniques to bioinformatics problems.
