I am the lab manager for the Trapnell Lab. I am interested in the mechanisms that control cellular reprogramming. I received my Bachelors in Biology from Seattle Pacific University. Prior joining the Trapnell Lab, I was in the Basic Sciences Division at Fred Hutchinson CRC, where I studied the replication and biology of Foamy viruses.  Life would not be complete without my beagle Bella.
