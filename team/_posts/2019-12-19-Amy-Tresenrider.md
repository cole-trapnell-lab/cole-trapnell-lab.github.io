I’m a Research Scientist leading the SeaHub data production team in the Trapnell lab. I oversee the experimental design and collection of large single cell sequencing datasets from zebrafish embryos subjected to various chemical and genetic perturbations. 

During my postdoc in the Trapnell lab, I collaborated with Tom Reh’s lab to use single cell sequencing to understand retinal development and regeneration in retinal organoids and mice. I attended graduate school at UC Berkeley, where I studied gene regulation during budding yeast meiosis with Elçin Ünal. I received my B.A. in Biology-Chemistry from Claremont McKenna College where I worked with Emily Wiley studying histone deacetylases in the ciliate T. thermophila. I also spent a year working with Stephen Leppla at the NIH where I engineered anthrax toxin fusion proteins to help kill cancer cells.
