As a postdoctoral fellow in the Trapnell lab, I am using single-cell genomics to model how developmental processess change in the face of environmental perturbations. I am interested in molecular determinants of cell type-specific stress senstivity and environmental sensing. I completed my PhD at the University of Washington with Christine Queitsch and Stanley Fields, where I developed high-throughput molecular techniques to study protein function. I received a B.S. in Genetics from the University of California, Davis, where I worked on genetic mapping of developmental traits in tomato with Siobhan Brady.
