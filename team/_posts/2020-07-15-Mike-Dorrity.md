As a postdoctoral fellow in the Trapnell lab, Mike Dorrity used single-cell genomics to model how developmental processess change in the face of environmental perturbations. He is interested in molecular determinants of cell type-specific stress senstivity and environmental sensing. He completed his PhD at the University of Washington with Christine Queitsch and Stanley Fields, where he developed high-throughput molecular techniques to study protein function. He received a B.S. in Genetics from the University of California, Davis, where he worked on genetic mapping of developmental traits in tomato with Siobhan Brady.

Mike is now a [Group Leader](https://www.embl.org/groups/dorrity/members/) at the EMBL in Heidelberg.
