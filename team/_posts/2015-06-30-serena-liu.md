I'm a Genome Sciences graduate student in the Trapnell lab. I received a B.A. in Biology with a minor in Economics from Dartmouth College. While at Dartmouth, I worked for over two years in the lab of [Thomas Jack](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~tjack/), studying the genetics of flower development in Arabidopsis thaliana. I also spent a summer with [Tianxi Cai](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tianxi-cai/) at the Harvard School of Public Health, working on developing gene expression-based models of autism incidence. As a Genome Sciences student, I'd like to expand upon my background in molecular biology with training in computational analysis, and to use new technologies to learn more about the mechanisms underlying cell development and differentiation.
