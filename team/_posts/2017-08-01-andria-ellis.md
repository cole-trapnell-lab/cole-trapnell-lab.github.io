Iâ€™m a Genome Sciences graduate student in the Trapnell lab. I received a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Boston University. While in Boston, I worked for over two years in the Bradham Lab, studying the skeletal development of sea urchins. I spent a summer on a Bioinformatics REU, working more computationally in the lab, developing an image analysis program that could track cells during development.
As a Genome Sciences student, I want to continue to grow both computationally and experimentally. I am interested in gene regulation during differentiation and development, and in new technologies to uncover networks of gene regulation.
