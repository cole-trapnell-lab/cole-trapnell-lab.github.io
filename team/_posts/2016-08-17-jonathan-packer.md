I am a Genome sciences graduate student jointly advised by Cole and Bob Waterston. I received a B.S. in Operations Research from Columbia University and concurrently worked as a software engineer at a tech startup in NYC. I enjoyed quantitative modeling but wanted to find applications beyond finance and ad-tech. This drove me to switch fields to biology. Before arriving at UW, I spent two summers interning at the Regeneron Genetics Center, developing methods to integrate phenotypic information derived from electronic medical records with a large-scale exome sequencing project. At UW, I am investigating methods for inferring which transcription factors mediate cell state changes observed in a given single cell sequencing experiment. I am applying these methods to data from both mammalian cell cultures and the model organism C. elegans.
