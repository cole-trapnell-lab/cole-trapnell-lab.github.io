I'm a PhD student in the the Department of Genome Sciences. I earned a B.S. in biochemistry, and applied computational mathematical sciences from the University of Washington, as well as a graduate certificate in electrical engineering from the University of Washington. After undergrad I worked in the [Subramanian Lab](https://isbscience.org/people/labs/subramanian-lab/) at the Institute for Systems Biology using omics approaches to study infectious disease in human cohorts.

My current interests include using high throughput single cell and imaging technologies to study vertebrate development. I am particularly interested in understanding where and when and how epigenetic regulators modulate gene expression in the developing embryo, and which processes are disrupted when these proteins are lost.

When Iâ€™m not in the lab I like to get outside skiing, whitewater kayaking, mountain biking, backpacking and trail running making the most of what the PNW has to offer.
