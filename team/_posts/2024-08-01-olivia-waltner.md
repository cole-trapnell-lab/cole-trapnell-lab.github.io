I am a Genome Science graduate student in the Trapnell Lab, using Sci-Plex and perturbation strategies to study the specification of the lateral plate mesoderm, which gives rise to the immune system, heart, kidneys, and limb buds.

I earned my bachelor’s in biology from Whitman College. Before joining the Trapnell Lab, I worked as a single-cell research technician at the Fred Hutch Cancer Cetner in Dr. Scott Furlan’s lab. I collaborated closely with Dr. Geoff Hill’s lab to study CD8 T-cell exhaustion in multiple myeloma.

I enjoy skiing, volleyball, running, baking, and spending time with my cat, Loaf.
