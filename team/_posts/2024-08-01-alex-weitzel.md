I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Trapnell Lab. I am interested in integrating comparative genomics with single-cell multi-omic strategies to understand how genome evolution dictates cellular identity and developmental processes. I am also interested in expanding the zebrafish genetic toolkit to better dissect developmental processes.

I completed my Ph.D. in Biology at UC San Diego in the lab of Kimberly Cooper, where I worked on methods for precise genetic manipulation in mice (tissue specific multi-gene knockouts, and genotype conversion) using genetically encoded Cas9 and studied macroevolutionary process of vertebrate skeletal proportion by combining comparative genomics, interspecies omics, and precise interspecies transgenesis.

Outside of lab I enjoy making music and art, generally all outdoor activities, a responsible amount of video games, and trying to throw really big rocks not that far into bodies of water.
