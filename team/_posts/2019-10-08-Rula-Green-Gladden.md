I am a physician currently in fellowship in pediatric hematology/oncology. My research in the Trapnell lab focuses on using single cell genomics to understand mechanisms of AML resistance to treatment.

Before joining the Trapnell lab, I received my B.S. in biochemistry, with a minor in Spanish, at the University of Washington. As an undergraduate and shortly following graduation I worked in the labs of Eugene Nester, John Aitchison, and David Koelle. Following graduation, I received the Bonderman Travel Fellowship. I went on to receive my MD from Cornell, where I was a recipient of the Doris Duke Clinical Research Fellowship and studied maternal-to-fetal transmission of HIV in Malawi. I completed my residency in pediatrics at New York Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical College. 

Pursuing an interest in pediatric hematology/oncology and academic medical education, I completed a year as a chief resident in pediatrics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center before starting fellowship at Seattle Childrenâ€™s Hospital.
