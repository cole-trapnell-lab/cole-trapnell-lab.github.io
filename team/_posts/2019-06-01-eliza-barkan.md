I’m a Computational Biologist and Lead Data Engineer at the SeaHub where I manage our perturbation analysis pipeline and data products. 

During my PhD in the Trapnell Lab, I mapped embryo-wide signaling pathway regulation of organogenesis, with a focus in the pectoral fin. Prior to graduate school, I received my Bachelor of Science degree from Bates College where I majored in Neuroscience and minored in Chemistry. I did my senior thesis in Jason Castro’s lab, where I determined the mode of opioid’s regulation of synaptic activity in the olfactory bulb. I then worked as a Research Associate at the Allen Institute for Brain Science with Rebecca Hodge on a large-scale project that characterized the hundreds of neuronal cell types in mouse and human cortex using single cell RNA-sequencing.
