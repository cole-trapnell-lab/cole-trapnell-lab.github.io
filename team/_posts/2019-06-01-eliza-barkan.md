I am a Molecular and Cellular Biology graduate student in the Trapnell Lab. I am interested in developing computational and experimental methods to understand gene regulation and expression in organismal development and disease.

Prior to graduate school, I received my Bachelor of Science degree from Bates College where I majored in Neuroscience and minored in Chemistry. I did my senior thesis in Jason Castro’s lab, where I worked on characterizing how opioids modulate synaptic activity in mouse accessory olfactory bulb. During the summers, I worked in Stanley McKnight’s lab at the University of Washington studying neuropharmacology, in Andrew Gundlach’s lab at the University of Melbourne studying neuropeptides, and in Christopher Henderson’s lab at Columbia University studying the role of several neuropeptides in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Prior to starting graduate school, I worked as a Research Associate at the Allen Institute for Brain Science with Rebecca Hodge on a project focused on characterizing the many complex cell types of mouse and human cortex using single cell RNA-sequencing, electrophysiology and cellular morphology.
