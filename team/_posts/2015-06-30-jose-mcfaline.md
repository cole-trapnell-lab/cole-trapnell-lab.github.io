I am a post-doctoral fellow in the Trapnell lab. I received my B.S. in Chemistry at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez. I then went on to complete my Ph.D. in Biology at MIT with a focus on Cancer Systems Biology in the laboratories of Professor [Leona Samson](http://samsonlab.mit.edu/) and Professor [Forest White](http://web.mit.edu/fwhitelab/). As a member of the Samson and White labs I worked on identifying mechanisms of chemoresistance in glioblastoma, the most common and malignant brain cancer. Using a variety of molecular biology and proteomic approaches I identified alterations in DNA repair and mitogenic signaling networks that modulate the response of glioblastoma cells to the main chemotherapeutic used in the treatment of the disease, temozolomide.
