I am a research scientist in the Trapnell Lab. I received a B.S. in Biochemistry and a B.A. in Chemistry from the University of Washington, and a M.S. in Bioinformatics from Johns Hopkins University. I have previously worked as a supervisor and research scientist at a company that performs food safety testing using microbiology and molecular biology techniques, but am now pursuing my interests in genomics and developmental biology.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy working on my numerous crafting projects and traveling.
