I'm a postdoc fellow joint-advised by William Noble and Cole Trapnell. I'm
interested in modeling genome 3D architecture and its dynamics in various
cellular processes such as differentiation. I'm also interested in understanding
how dynamics of genome architecture are related to gene regulation at
different stages of these processes. I got my B.S. in Biological Sciences from
Nankai University in China. I then completed my Ph.D. in Dr. Alan Grossfield's
lab at the University of Rochester, where I developed molecular models of
lipids and lipid membrane-targeted antimicrobial lipopeptides. I used molecular
dynamics simulations and statistical mechanics to investigate the molecular
mechanism of antimicrobial lipopeptides' interaction with lipid membranes.
