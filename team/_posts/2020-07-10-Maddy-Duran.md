Iâ€™m a Machine Learning Engineer in the Trapnell Lab, working at the Seahub developing AI tools for analyzing atlas-scale perturbation datasets.

I attended graduate school at the University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences. During my PhD in the Trapnell lab, I developed Hooke and Platt, two computational tools for differential analysis in single-cell perturbation data. Before that, I received a B.S. in Computer Science and Molecular Biology from MIT, conducting research in the Keating and Uhler labs. I also spent two years as an associate computational biologist at the Broad Institute, where I built an informatics pipeline for a pan-cancer liquid biopsy assay.
