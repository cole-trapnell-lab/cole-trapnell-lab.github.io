I am a Genome Sciences graduate student in the Trapnell Lab. I received my B.S. in Biology from UC San Diego. While attending UC San Diego, I worked in the [Ecker Plant Molecular Biology Lab](https://ecker.salk.edu/) where I studied gene regulation in plants under drought stress and planned / executed a massive single-cell project using sci-RNA-seq3. Here in the Trapnell Lab, I want to apply my technical skills to answer new questions centered around vertebrate development and disease with cutting-edge molecular biology tools.

When I have free time, I like to play guitar and bass, work on my project car, and read One Piece.
