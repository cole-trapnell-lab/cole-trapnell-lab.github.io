I am a Genome Sciences graduate student in the Trapnell and Queitsch labs. I received a B.S. in mechanical engineering and a minor in applied mathematics from the University of Washington. I worked in the medical device industry for several years then in the Nemhauser lab at UW for two years. I am currently interested in modeling gene expression based on regulatory sequence and chromatin accessibility.
