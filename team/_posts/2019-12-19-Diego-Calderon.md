Was a postdoc working with Cole Trapnell and Jay Shendure at University of Washington. Before that he received his Ph.D. from Stanford University, where he studied complex traits in the lab of [Jonathan Pritchard](http://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/home.html). He enjoys thinking about how DNA is translated into life.

Diego can now be found at [UCSF].(https://humangenetics.ucsf.edu/content/diego-calderon-phd)
