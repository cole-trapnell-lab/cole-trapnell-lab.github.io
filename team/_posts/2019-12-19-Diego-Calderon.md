I am a postdoc working with Cole Trapnell and Jay Shendure at University of Washington. Before that I received my Ph.D. from Stanford University, where I studied complex traits in the lab of [Jonathan Pritchard](http://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/home.html). I enjoy thinking about how DNA is translated into life.

With my free time I like to hike and to attempt watercolor painting.
