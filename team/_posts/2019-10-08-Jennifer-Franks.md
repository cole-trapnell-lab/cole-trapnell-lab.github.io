I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Trapnell lab. I am interested in the transcriptional processes that drive fibrosis in various organs. I received my BS from Purdue University in Applied Statistics and Genetics, and I completed my PhD in Quantitative Biomedical Sciences at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, while working with Michael Whitfield, PhD. In the Whitfield lab, I utilized machine learning approaches to identify gene-expression based subgroups of systemic sclerosis patients who were most likely to benefit from different treatments regimens.
