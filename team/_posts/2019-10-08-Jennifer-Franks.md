Was a postdoctoral fellow in the Trapnell lab. She's interested in the transcriptional processes that drive fibrosis in various organs. She received her BS from Purdue University in Applied Statistics and Genetics, and completed her PhD in Quantitative Biomedical Sciences at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, while working with Michael Whitfield, PhD. In the Whitfield lab, she utilized machine learning approaches to identify gene-expression based subgroups of systemic sclerosis patients who were most likely to benefit from different treatments regimens.
