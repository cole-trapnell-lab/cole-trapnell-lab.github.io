Iâ€™m an [MD/PhD student](http://mstp.washington.edu) at the University of Washington in the Computer Science and Engineering program. My research interests are in molecular recording and computational tools developmental for developmental biology and neuroscience. As a dual degree candidate, I am looking to improve the way that neurologic and psychiatric disease is treated.

My prior eduction and training includes a Sc.B. and M.Eng in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT. At MIT I worked in the lab of [Earl Miller](https://ekmillerlab.mit.edu) developing new methods of closed loop neural stimulation. I received my masters under the mentorship of [Emery Brown](https://www.neurostat.mit.edu) and [Patrick Purdon](https://purdonlab.mgh.harvard.edu) developing time series decomposition strategies for the electroencephalogram (EEG) during anesthesia and opioid drug overdose.

In my free time I pursue entrepreneurial projects and run with a track club.
