I am a postdoctoral fellow jointly advised by Cole Trapnell and Andrea Wills (UW Biochemistry Department). Here, I am using single cell sequencing approaches to investigate cytokine signaling in lung inflammation in the mouse M. musculus as well as immune-neuron immune interactions in the context of spinal cord regeneration in the frog X. tropicalis. I earned my PhD in Molecular and Cellular Biology from the University of Washington in the lab of Jay Parrish, where I assessed the impact of tool choice on RNA-sequencing analysis to provide recommendations on best practices and uncovered a role for the epidermis in sensation in the fruit fly D. melanogaster. Prior to graduate school, I studied development of neuronal shape in the nematode C. elegans with Max Heiman at Harvard Medical School and researched injury-induced neuronal growth in the cricket G. bimaculatus at with Hadley Horch at Bowdoin College, where I earned my B.A in Neurobiology.
