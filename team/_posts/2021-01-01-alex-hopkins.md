I administratively support the Trapnell Lab, as well as the [Center for Multiplex Assessment of Phenotype](https://www.cmap.gs.washington.edu/), and the [Atlas of Variant Effects Alliance](https://www.varianteffect.org/).
Prior to working for the University of Washington, I worked in social services administration. Outside of the lab, I enjoy seeing movies and traveling.
