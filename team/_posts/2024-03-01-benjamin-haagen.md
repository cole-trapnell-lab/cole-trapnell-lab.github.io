I am a research scientist in the Trapnell Lab. I received a B.S. in Biology from 
the University of Washington during which I worked in Dr. Jennifer 
Nemhauserâ€™s lab studying the roles of photoreceptors in Brassica rapa 
development. During graduate school at Western Washington University, I 
worked with Dr. Dan Pollard to study the effects of natural genetic variation 
on trait variation between budding yeast cells responding to dynamic 
environments.

I worked during the COVID-19 pandemic as a technician with a medical 
testing company to develop high-throughput testing assays. I am broadly 
interested in utilizing genetic and genomic techniques to understand how 
organisms and populations respond evolutionarily to environmental change. I
am passionate about science education and have worked with several non-
profits in various roles to improve student access and agency in studying 
science.

Outside of work I enjoy time with family, trail running, mountaineering.
