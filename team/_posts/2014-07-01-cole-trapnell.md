I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of [Genome Sciences](http://www.gs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington.  I study cell differentiation, reprogramming and cell-cell communication. I also develop technologies to help identify genes that regulate these processes.  

I received my bachelor's degree and my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Maryland. As a graduate student, I was co-advised by [Steven Salzberg](http://ccb.jhu.edu/people/salzberg/Salzberg/Salzberg_Lab_Home.html), and [Lior Pachter](http://math.berkeley.edu/~lpachter/) from the University of California, Berkeley, where I was a visiting student for several years. While working with Steven and Lior, I wrote TopHat and Cufflinks, and I helped Ben Langmead with Bowtie. I trained as postdoc in [John Rinn](http://www.rinnlab.com/)'s lab at Harvard's Department of [Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology](http://www.scrb.harvard.edu/), where I learned to work with stem cells.  Near the end of my time at Harvard, I worked with Davide Cacchiarelli on Monocle.
