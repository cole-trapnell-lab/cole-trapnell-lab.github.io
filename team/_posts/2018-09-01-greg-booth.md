Greg Booth was a postdoctoral fellow in the Trapnell lab. He is interested in understanding how chromatin and the non-coding genome influences complex transcriptional programs in development and disease. He earned his bachelorâ€™s degree at the University of Toronto and received his PhD from Cornell University, where he worked under John Lis to study the function and evolution of mechanisms that regulate gene transcription.

Greg is now Director of Assay Development at [Kanvas Biosciences](https://www.kanvasbio.com/).
