I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Trapnell lab. I’m interested in understanding how chromatin and the non-coding genome influences complex transcriptional programs, such as development and disease. I earned my bachelor’s degree at the University of Toronto and received my PhD from Cornell University, where I worked under John Lis to study the function and evolution of mechanisms that regulate gene transcription.
