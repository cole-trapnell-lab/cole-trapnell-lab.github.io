I am a Damon Runyon Quantitative Biolgy Fellow working in the Trapnell Lab at the University of Washington. Prior to joining the Trapnell Lab, I received my Ph.D. in Biophysics at UC Berkeley under the mentorship of Dr. [Hernan Garcia](http://garcialab.berkeley.edu/). During my time at Berkeley, I pursued multiple projects that combined live imaging experiments, statistical physics, and computational modeling to uncover the molecular mechanisms that shape how eukaryotic genes read and respond to input concentrations of transcription factor proteins. As a postdoc in the Trapnell Lab, I am working to develop new computational and experimental methods that integrate single-cell transcriptomics with live imaging to uncover how gene regulatory networks drive developmental outcomes.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, and playing soccer.
