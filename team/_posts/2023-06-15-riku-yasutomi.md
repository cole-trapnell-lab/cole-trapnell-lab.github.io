I am a Genome Sciences MD/PhD student co-advised by Cole and [Cecilia Moens](https://research.fredhutch.org/moens/en.html). I received my bachelor’s degree in Molecular and Cell Biology from UC Berkeley. I spent my undergrad and the following 2 years in [Iswar Hariharan](https://mcb.berkeley.edu/labs/hariharan/)’s lab where I studied the development and regeneration of Drosophila wing imaginal discs. Thanks to Iswar and my wonderful mentors in the lab, I found my love for science, genetics, and developmental biology. During my undergrad I also spent a summer in [Tatsushi Igaki](https://igakilab.lif.kyoto-u.ac.jp/)’s lab at Kyoto University where I studied wound healing, also in Drosophila wing imaginal discs. I am currently interested in applying single-cell analysis to understand the mechanisms of Zebrafish brain development.
