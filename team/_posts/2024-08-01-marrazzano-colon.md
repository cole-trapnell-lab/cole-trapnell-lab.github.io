I am a PhD student in the Department of Genome Sciences. Prior to being a member of the Trapnell Lab, I received a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Economics from Duke University. After I graduated, I was research tech in the Qian Li lab studying cardiomyocyte reprograming.

My current interests include integrating different ’omics technologies to gain deeper insights into biology—for example, combining high-throughput single-cell and high-throughput imaging technologies. I am particularly interested in cell fate decisions and gene regulation in development.

Outside of lab, I like to fish, listen to classical music, latin dance, and go hiking and traveling!
