I am currently an undergraduate student in the Electrical Engineering department. I am responsible for debugging and adding small enhancements to Monocle while also assisting in the maintenance of the Monocle and Cell Atlas of Worm websites. Prior to working in the Trapnell Lab, I worked as an undergraduate research intern in Wenying Shouâ€™s Lab where I developed scripts that calculated the birth and death rates of fluorescent cells by analyzing microscope images. In my free time I enjoy developing Android applications.
