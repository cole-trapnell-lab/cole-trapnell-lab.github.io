I’m an MD/PhD student at the [University of Washington](http://www.mstp.washington.edu/). My postdoctoral research is joint between the Trapnell and Shendure labs.

My prior education includes a bachelor's degree in Bioengineering with an emphasis in Stem Cell Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley.  Before matriculating at University of Washington, I worked as a crystallographer in [Peter Kwong](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/labsandresources/labs/aboutlabs/vrc/structuralbiologylaboratory/Pages/kwong.aspx)’s lab at the National Institutes of Health. There, I focused primarily on the development of structure-based vaccine for HIV-1, and trained in the techniques of protein biochemistry and X-Ray crystallography.    

In my free time [I like turtles](https://youtu.be/CMNry4PE93Y), sipping coffee and climbing rocks.
