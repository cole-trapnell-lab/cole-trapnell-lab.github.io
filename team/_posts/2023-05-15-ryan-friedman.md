I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Trapnell Lab. I am interested in how vertebrate development is encoded into DNA. I am developing new computational methods that infer gene regulatory networks and prioritize new experiments to reveal mechanisms underlying zebrafish development.

I received my bachelorâ€™s degree and my Ph.D. in Computational and Systems Biology from Washington University in St. Louis. As a graduate student, I studied gene regulation with [Barak Cohen](https://bclab.wustl.edu/) and [Mike White](https://sites.wustl.edu/mwhite/). I developed an active machine learning framework to iteratively design experiments that reveal the cis-regulatory grammar of CRX, the primary transcription factor controlling mammalian photoreceptor differentiation.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy cooking, reading, playing video games, and listening to music.
