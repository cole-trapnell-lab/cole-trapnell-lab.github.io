I’m a postdoctoral fellow in the Trapnell lab. I'm interested in the transcriptional programs that drive cell lineage specification during embryonic and post-embryonic development. I completed my PhD at the University of Washington with [David Parichy](http://dparichy.as.virginia.edu/) and Cole Trapnell where I studied how thyroid hormone, a common endocrine signal, coordinates neural crest derived lineages during post-embryonic development in zebrafish. I received a B.A. in Biology from St. Olaf College. And before starting graduate school, I studied blood vessel development and morphogenesis in Dr. Victoria Bautch’s lab at UNC-Chapel Hill.
