I’m a graduate student in the Molecular and Cellular Biology program and am co-mentored by Cole and [David Parichy](http://dparichy.as.virginia.edu/). I’m interested in endocrine regulation of cell fate specification during post-embryonic development. Specifically, I’m studying how thyroid hormone, a common endocrine signal, coordinates neural crest derived lineages during post-embryonic development in zebrafish.

I received a B.A. in Biology from St. Olaf College. And before starting graduate school, I studied blood vessel development and morphogenesis in Dr. Victoria Bautch’s lab at UNC-Chapel Hill.
