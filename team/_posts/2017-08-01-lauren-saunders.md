Lauren Saunders was a postdoctoral fellow in the Trapnell lab. She is interested in the transcriptional programs that drive cell lineage specification during embryonic and post-embryonic development. She completed her PhD at the University of Washington with [David Parichy](http://dparichy.as.virginia.edu/) and Cole Trapnell where she studied how thyroid hormone, a common endocrine signal, coordinates neural crest derived lineages during post-embryonic development in zebrafish. She received a B.A. in Biology from St. Olaf College. And before starting graduate school, I studied blood vessel development and morphogenesis in Dr. Victoria Bautchâ€™s lab at UNC-Chapel Hill.

Lauren is now a scientist at the [EMBL](https://www.embl.org/sites/heidelberg/) in Heidelberg
