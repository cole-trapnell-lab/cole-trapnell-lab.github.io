Iâ€™m a Genome Sciences graduate student jointly advised by Cole and Doug Fowler. I'm interested in combining microscopy and single cell sequencing technologies to understand transcriptional dynamics in diseases. I earned a B.S. in Applied Computational Mathematical Sciences, Biochemistry, and Chemistry from University of Washington. As an undergrad, I worked in the Vaughan lab, where I helped develop new methods for Expansion Microscopy and apply them to study neural development in Drosophila melanogaster.
