I am a Genome Sciences graduate student in the Trapnell lab. I received a B.S. in biochemistry and a minor in computer science from the University of Michigan. At Michigan, I spent two years in the Engelke lab studying yeast prion proteins and human homologues. I then spent two years on a joint project working for the Telesnitsky and Kidd labs, studying HIV latency. In the Trapnell lab I am interested in using single cell technologies to understand uncontrolled cellular proliferation in disease.
