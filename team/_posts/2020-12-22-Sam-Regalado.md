Was a Genome Sciences and MSTP graduate student co-advised by Jay Shendure and Cole Trapnell. He received a B.A. in Molecular and Cell Biology from UC Berkeley. Prior to attending graduate school, he was an HHMI fellow and then a staff research associate at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and UC Berkeley, where he used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to investigate mechanisms of aging and tumorigenesis in murine and human pluripotent stem cell models. His interests lie at the intersection of gene regulation, stem cell differentiation, and single cell genomics.
