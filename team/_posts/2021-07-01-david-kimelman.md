I have been working on the study of early vertebrate development for over 35 years, starting first in frogs (*Xenopus*) and more recently studying zebrafish. After having run a successful [lab](http://depts.washington.edu/kimellab/) for over 30 years, I felt that though the science was going well I wanted to move on to other challenges and so I officially retired Sept. 1, 2021. However, during the last year running my lab I started a collaboration with the Trapnell lab to use single-cell genomics to understand zebrafish embryogenesis. Single-cell technologies have huge potential for helping us understand embryonic development. Thus, when Cole asked me to continue working with him I readily agreed, since I felt this gave me the new challenge I was looking for. Our research interests are very synergistic, combining my history in studying vertebrate embryos with the Trapnell lab's expertise in single cell technology. With the opportunity now to work full time at the bench, I am very happy to be able to help members of the Trapnell lab working on zebrafish to move their projects forward.
