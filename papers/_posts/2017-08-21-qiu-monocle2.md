# Abstract

Single-cell trajectories can unveil how gene regulation governs
cell fate decisions. However, learning the structure of complex
trajectories with multiple branches remains a challenging
computational problem. We present Monocle 2, an algorithm
that uses reversed graph embedding to describe multiple fate
decisions in a fully unsupervised manner. We applied Monocle 2
to two studies of blood development and found that mutations
in the genes encoding key lineage transcription factors divert
cells to alternative fates.
