# Abstract

Gene regulation occurs through trans-acting factors (e.g. transcription factors) acting on cis-regulatory elements (e.g. enhancers). Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) functionally survey large numbers of cis-regulatory elements for regulatory potential, but do not identify the trans-acting factors that mediate any observed effects. Here we describe transMPRA â€” a reporter assay that efficiently combines multiplex CRISPR-mediated perturbation and MPRAs to identify trans-acting factors that modulate the regulatory activity of specific enhancers.
