# Abstract

Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) develop from haemogenic endothelium (HE) within
embryonic arterial vessels such as the aorta of the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region (AGM).
To identify the signals responsible for HSC formation, we used single cell RNA-sequencing to
simultaneously analyze the transcriptional profiles of AGM-derived cells transitioning from HE to HSC, and AGM-derived endothelial cells which provide signals sufficient to support HSC
maturation and self-renewal. Pseudotemporal ordering revealed dynamics of gene expression
during the HE to HSC transition, identifying surface receptors specifically expressed on
developing HSCs. Transcriptional profiles of niche endothelial cells enabled identification of
corresponding ligands, including those signaling to Notch receptors, VLA-4 integrin, and
CXCR4, which, when integrated in an engineered platform, were sufficient to support the
generation of engrafting HSCs. These studies provide a transcriptional map of the signaling
interactions necessary for the development of HSCs and advance the goal of engineering HSC
for therapeutic applications.
