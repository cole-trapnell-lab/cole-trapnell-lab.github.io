# Abstract

Although numerous approaches have been developed to map RNA-binding sites of individual RNA-binding proteins
(RBPs), few methods exist that allow assessment of global RBP–RNA interactions. Here, we describe PIP-seq, a universal,
high-throughput, ribonuclease-mediated protein footprint sequencing approach that reveals RNA-protein interaction
sites throughout a transcriptome of interest. We apply PIP-seq to the HeLa transcriptome and compare binding sites
found using different cross-linkers and ribonucleases. From this analysis, we identify numerous putative RBP-binding
motifs, reveal novel insights into co-binding by RBPs, and uncover a significant enrichment for disease-associated
polymorphisms within RBP interaction sites.
