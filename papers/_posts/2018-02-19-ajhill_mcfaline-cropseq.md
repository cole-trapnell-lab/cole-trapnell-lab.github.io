# Abstract

Several groups recently coupled CRISPR perturbations and
single-cell RNA-seq for pooled genetic screens. We demonstrate
that vector designs of these studies are susceptible to ~50%
swapping of guide RNA–barcode associations because of lentiviral
template switching. We optimized a published alternative,
CROP-seq, in which the guide RNA also serves as the barcode,
and here confirm that this strategy performs robustly and doubled
the rate at which guides are assigned to cells to 94%.
