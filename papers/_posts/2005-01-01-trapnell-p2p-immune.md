# Abstract

This paper describes a multi-agent strategy for blacklisting malicious nodes in a peer-to-peer network that is inspired by the innate immune system, including the recruitment of leukocytes to the site of an infection in the human body. Agents are based on macrophages, T-cells, and tumor necrosis factor, and exist on network nodes that have properties drawn from vascular endothelial tissue. Here I show that this strategy succeeds in blacklisting malicious nodes from the network using non-specific recruitment. This strategy is sensitive to parameters that affect the recruitment of leukocyte agents to malicious nodes. The strategy can eliminate even a large, uniform distribution of malicious nodes in the network.
