# Abstract

Single-cell genomic approaches have the potential to revolutionize the study of plant systems. Here, we highlight newly developed techniques to analyze transcriptomes at single-cell resolution. We focus on the rigorous standards necessary to generate and compare these data sets introducing analysis methods that can be applied to interpret their results. Lastly, we discuss the inherent limitations of single-cell studies and address future directions for plant single-cell genomics.
