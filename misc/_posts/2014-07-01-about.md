##The Trapnell Lab
Cole Trapnell's lab started at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/) in July of 2014, in the [Department of Genome Sciences](http://www.gs.washington.edu/).  The lab studies cell differentiation, reprogramming, and other transitions between stable or meta-stable cell states.  The lab also studies cell-cell signaling and its role in these processes.  The use both computational and experimental approaches, and often work at single-cell, genomic resolution. 

Cole's lab is not to be confused with that of his father, [Bruce Trapnell](http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/bio/t/bruce-trapnell/).  Bruce studies alveolar macrophage function and the role of macrophages in immune disorders, particularly pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.  

##The Lab Website

The Trapnell lab website was heavily inspired by the site for [Trevor Bedford](http://bedford.io/)'s lab.  Trevor put together a site that showcases his lab's science to the world, as they produce it, in real time.

You can see the source code for the Bedford lab site.  It's [freely available on GitHub](https://github.com/blab/blotter).  All code is placed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/blab/blotter#license). The Bedford lab also provides some [documentation](http://bedford.io/misc/about/) about how they link each [project](http://bedford.io/projects/)'s GitHub repository into the main site.
