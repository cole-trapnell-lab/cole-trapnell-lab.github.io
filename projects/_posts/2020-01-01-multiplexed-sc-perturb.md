Genetic screening has been a cornerstone in efforts to dissect the program that controls how cells exert their functions or break down in disease. High-throughput chemical screens typically employ coarse assays, (e.g. cell survival) or inspect gross anatomic phenotypes, limiting what can be learned about mechanisms of action, off-target effects, and heterogeneous responses. Single-cell sequencing provides a means of interrogating the molecular consequences of genetic, chemical, or environmental perturbations, but limited sample multiplexing in commercial platforms makes screening infeasible. We have developed and continue to improve various methods for highly multiplexed single-cell sequencing experiments. We have applied these tools to study diverse biological systems including cancer cells and whole zebrafish embryos.

Single-cell RNA-Seq reports the mRNA abundances of every gene in the genome in many individual cells in a single experiment. In collaboration with [Jay Shendure's lab](http://krishna.gs.washington.edu/) and scientists at [Illumina](http://www.illumina.com/), we recently developed sci-RNA-seq, which uses combinatorial cellular indexing, captures transcriptomes for tens of thousands of cells in a single experiment for a fraction of the cost of alternative methods.  The technique scales sublinearly in time and cost, enabling the profiling of all the cells in whole animals.   -->
