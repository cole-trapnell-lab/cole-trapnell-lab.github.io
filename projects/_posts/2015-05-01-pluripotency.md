How do stem cells maintain the capacity to generate the myriad other cell types in our bodies? What gene regulatory circuits control a stem cell's choice of what cell type to generate via differentiation? We are interested in the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of pluripotency and self-renewal, the hallmarks of stem cells. We are also interested in the regulated exit from the pluripotent state during cell differentiation. Finally, we aim to understand the extent to which decisions made during development are reversible via cellular reprogramming.
