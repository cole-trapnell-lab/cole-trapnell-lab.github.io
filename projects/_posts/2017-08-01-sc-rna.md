Single-cell RNA-Seq reports the mRNA abundances of every gene in the genome in many individual cells in a single experiment. In collaboration with [Jay Shendure's lab](http://krishna.gs.washington.edu/) and scientists at [Illumina](http://www.illumina.com/), we recently developed sci-RNA-seq, which uses combinatorial cellular indexing, captures transcriptomes for tens of thousands of cells in a single experiment for a fraction of the cost of alternative methods.  The technique scales sublinearly in time and cost, enabling the profiling of all the cells in whole animals.
